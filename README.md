# Electronite CLI

This drop-in replacement for [electron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron) will install
electronite instead of just electron.

## Why?
Electronite is a fork of Electron that has been compiled with [Graphite](https://graphite.sil.org/).

> Graphite is a "smart font" system developed specifically to handle the complexities of lesser-known languages of the world.

## Development

When a new version of this package is released, the corresponding version of `electron.d.ts` needs to be copied from https://github.com/electron/electron/releases.
